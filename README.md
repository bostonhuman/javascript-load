# Javascript Load
The load event is commonly used to trigger scripts that access the contents of the page. In this example, a function called setup() gives focus to the text input when the page has loaded. The event is automatically raised by the window object when a page has finished loading the HTML and all of its resources: images, CSS, scripts (even third party content.)
